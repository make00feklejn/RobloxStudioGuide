        <h2>üéÆ What Is a Script in Roblox?</h2>
        <p>A script is a small program that tells Roblox what to do. For example, you can write a script that opens a door when a player clicks a button, or one that keeps track of a player‚Äôs score. Scripts are written in Lua and are added to objects in your game.</p>
        <p>There are a few types of scripts in Roblox:</p>
        <p>Script: Runs on the server (used for game logic and multiplayer).</p>
        <p>LocalScript: Runs on the client (used for UI and player input).</p>
        <p>ModuleScript: Contains reusable code you can include in other scripts.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>üß∞ How to Add a Script</h2>
        <p>Open Roblox Studio and start a new project (Baseplate is a good choice).</p>
        <p>In the Explorer, right-click on an object like a Part.</p>
        <p>Choose Insert Object > Script.</p>
        <p>A new window will open with a default line of code:</p>
        <img src="1page3.png">
        <p>Click Play (F5) to run the game. You‚Äôll see "Hello world!" in the Output window.</p>
        <img src="2page3.png">
        <p>That's your first sript!</p>
        <br>
        <h2>üß™ Basic Lua Concepts</h2>
        <p>Here are a few simple coding concepts you‚Äôll need:</p>
        <p>üß± Variables</p>
        <p>Variables store data:</p>
        <img src="3page3.png">
        <p>üîÅ Functions</p>
        <p>Functions are blocks of code that do something:</p>
        <img src="4page3.png">
        <p>üì¢ Events</p>
        <p>Events let your game respond to actions:</p>
        <img src="5page3.png">
        <p>üß† Simple Scripting Example: Touch to Change Color</p>
        <p>Insert a Part into the game.</p>
        <p>Add a Script inside the part.</p>
        <p>This is the code:</p>
        <img src="6page3.png">
        <p>Now when the player touches the part, it changes color!</p>
        <p>üîÅ Loops: Repeating Actions</p>
        <p>Loops let you repeat code automatically, either a certain number of times or continuously while a condition is true.</p>
        <p>1. While Loop</p>
        <p>Runs the code as long as the condition is true.</p>
        <img src="7page3.png">
        <p>This will print "Counter is: 0" up to "Counter is: 4" and stop.</p>
        <p>2. For Loop</p>
        <p>Great for running code a specific number of times.</p>
        <img src="8page3.png">
        <p> This prints from 1 to 5. The loop ends when i reaches 5.</p>
        <p>You can also count backwards:</p>
        <img src="9page3.png">
        <p>3. Repeat Until Loop</p>
        <p>This loop runs at least once, and repeats until the condition becomes true.</p>
        <img src="10page3.png">
        <p> This will run 4 times, printing x from 0 to 3.</p>
        <p>‚ö° Conditional Statements: Making Decisions</p>
        <p>Conditional statements let your script decide what to do based on conditions.</p>
        <p>1. If Statement</p>
        <p>Runs code only if the condition is true.</p>
        <img src="11page3.png">
        <p>2. If-Else Statement</p>
        <p>Adds an alternative action if the condition is false.</p>
        <img src="12page3.png">
        <p>3. If - ElseIf - Else</p>
        <p>Check multiple conditions in a row.</p>
        <img src="13page3.png">
        <p>Only one of the conditions will run, based on the value of score.</p>
        <p>‚úÖ Tips for Using Loops and If Statements</p>
        <p>Use == to check if values are equal (not =).</p>
        <p>Use and and or to combine conditions.</p>
        <p>Be careful with infinite loops (like while true do) ‚Äî always include a wait() inside them to avoid freezing Roblox Studio!</p>
        <img src="14page3.png">
        <p>Mastering loops and conditions is a big step forward in scripting! Once you understand these, you can build logic for enemies, timers, scoring systems, power-ups, and more.</p>
        <p>üîÑ 3. Tables ‚Äì Storing Multiple Values</p>
        <p>Tables in Lua are like lists or containers.</p>
        <img src="15page3.png">
        <p>Tables can also store key-value pairs:</p>
        <img src="16page3.png">
        <p>Tables are very useful for inventories, leaderboards, or storing multiple players' data.</p>
        <p>üß† 4. Variables and Scope</p>
        <p>Variables store data and can be reused. You‚Äôve seen local variables, which are limited to the current block of code.</p>
        <p>If you declare a variable outside a function, it can be accessed globally (not recommended unless needed).</p>
        <p>üß± 5. Object Properties and Manipulation</p>
        <p>You can change objects in the game using scripts. Here are a few examples:</p>
        <img src="17page3.png">
        <p>You can also move parts using their Position or CFrame.</p>
        <img src="18page3.png">
        <p>üßº 6. Cleaning Up: Destroying and Disabling</p>
        <p>You can remove objects from the game with :Destroy():</p>
        <img src="19page3.png">
        <p>‚Ä¶then you‚Äôre well on your way to becoming a Roblox game developer. Keep experimenting, break things on purpose, and fix them ‚Äî that's how real programmers learn.</p>
